# Finer is Better: NVFP4 Quantization Evaluation

This directory contains our consolidated codebase for evaluating baseline perplexity and custom NVFP4 quantization with microscaling on large language models, intended to reproduce findings from paper 2601.19026.

This file is intended to be fully self-explanatory. Follow the steps below to set up the environment and run experiments.

## Setup

To set up the environment on a new machine or VM, follow these steps exactly:

1.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**:
    Run these commands in your terminal to create a new Python virtual environment and install the required packages:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv ~/quant_eval_venv
    source ~/quant_eval_venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install torch transformers datasets tqdm pandas tabulate
    ```

2.  **Clone and Install Paper\s Repository**:
